# LinearRegression_model
In this project it is demonstrated how to use Linear Regression Model to predict total sales of a company by using independent variables as money being spent on Advertising/Marketing on various fields. 

We will do 
* Exploratory Data Analysis- using distplot, scatterplot, pairplot.
* Feature engineering- using heatmap to check the correlation among input and target variables, multicollinearity among input variables.
* Outliers are handled - using boxplot, using IQR method and replacing it with median value.
* splitting the data for training and testing.
* Model building
* Predictions
* Model Evaluation
